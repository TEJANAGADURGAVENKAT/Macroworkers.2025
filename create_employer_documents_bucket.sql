INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'employer-documents',
  'employer-documents',
  false,
  10485760, -- 10MB limit
  ARRAY['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/jpg']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Create RLS policies for storage.objects
CREATE POLICY "Allow employers to upload documents" 
ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'employer-documents' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow employers to view their documents" 
ON storage.objects 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'employer-documents' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow employers to delete their documents" 
ON storage.objects 
FOR DELETE 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'employer-documents' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- 3. Allow admins to access all employer documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow admins to access all employer documents" 
ON storage.objects 
FOR ALL 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'employer-documents' 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
